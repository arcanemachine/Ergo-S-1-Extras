## Printable tenting stand

I found a 3d-printable tablet stand on Thingiverse which works well as an adjustable tenting stand for the Ergo S-1:

Since it's licensed [CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), I added [a copy of the STL](https://github.com/arcanemachine/Ergo-S-1/blob/main/STL/tenting-stand.stl) to this repo.

To keep everything from sliding around, I put a big rubber mat under my keybaord. For maximum cheapskate-ness, I used a kitchen drawer liner mat that I got at the dollar store.

I also used [a couple of these 3d-printed "washers"](https://github.com/arcanemachine/Ergo-S-1/blob/main/STL/tenting-stand-mount.stl) (and 2 M4x15mm screws) to secure the bottom of the keyboard to the tenting stand (it attaches to one of the heat-set inserts on the bottom). Not perfect, but better than just letting the keyboard just sit on the tenting stand.

Thanks to [mishkin2](https://www.thingiverse.com/mishkin2/designs) for this excellent creation!
